Statistics Collector
====================

QemuStat implements collector of numerical data with scale of 1 second.
There two types of users:

 - Writers collect data.
 - Readers checkout data that was collected for the last few seconds.

Maximum number of seconds the data must be available for reading is set during
initialisation.
Single user can have separated collectors for different sources of data. For
example, network traffic and network packets. From other side, a data source
can be collected in different collectors (e.g. network traffic in total and
NIC-specific).

Internals
---------

Collector implemented as a circular buffer, where every element correspond to a
second.

Statistics Logger
=================

QemuStatSched is a Reader of collectors. Its task is to make user-friendly
output of collected data.

Logger prints statistics per second with a fixed interval. Destination of the
output is set during initialisation that can be any valid file descriptor.
